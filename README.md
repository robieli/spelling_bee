This is just a simple little program I made to solve the New York Times Spelling Bee!

Enter the letters in `letters.txt` with the yellow letter coming first, then run `spelling-bee` in the command line to print out the words.

The best English word file I could find has a _very_ wide variety of words coming from many different English dialects, so not all of the words always work.
